    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Canopy Cancer Support Matcher ("we", "our", or "the app") helps match cancer patients with relevant support resources. We take your privacy seriously, especially given the sensitive nature of health information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The app collects the answers you provide during the questionnaire (age, general location, diagnosis type, and types of help needed). This information is used solely to match you with relevant resources.</p>
    <p>We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information. All sessions are anonymous.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your questionnaire responses are used only to generate personalized resource matches. We do not sell, share, or use your data for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>Session data is stored temporarily on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the United States and is automatically deleted after expiration. We do not retain your data indefinitely.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>Health Information</h2>
    <p>While the app asks about general diagnosis categories, it does not collect detailed medical records or protected health information (PHI) as defined by HIPAA.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at arihant@complete.city.</p>
